    <h2>Deep‑Tech Advisory & Venture Building</h2>

    <p>
      Organizations often uncover promising discoveries in their R&D environments but lack the technical,
      operational, or commercial clarity to turn them into viable products. VAIRA Advisory bridges this gap.
      With <strong>deep engineering expertise</strong> and <strong>hands‑on founder experience</strong>, we help teams evaluate the
      true potential of early‑stage technologies and establish a structured path from lab insight to market‑ready innovation.
    </p>

    <h3>What we do</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>TRL/MRL assessment</strong> to structure development and reduce risk</li>
      <li><strong>Capability evaluation</strong> across team, equipment, and budget</li>
      <li><strong>Supplier selection</strong> and early prototyping guidance</li>
      <li>Support for outsourcing and integration of external expertise</li>
      <li>Embedded coaching to strengthen internal teams</li>
      <li>Support for early‑stage founders in building technical teams and roadmaps</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Outcomes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clear roadmap</strong> from discovery to commercial prototype</li>
      <li><strong>Reduced complexity</strong> and faster decision‑making</li>
      <li><strong>First‑time‑right</strong> development cycles</li>
      <li>Lower engineering costs compared to traditional providers</li>
      <li>Stronger internal capability building</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Case Example</h3>
    <p>
      A university‑affiliated team developed a novel materials‑based technology and filed initial patents.
      VAIRA defined a <strong>TRL‑based development plan</strong>, identified suppliers, oversaw BOM decisions, and supported
      early market analysis — accelerating their path toward commercialization.
