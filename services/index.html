    <h2>Deep‑Tech Advisory</h2>
    <p>
      Organizations often uncover promising discoveries in their R&D environments but lack the technical,
      operational, or commercial clarity to turn them into viable products. VAIRA Advisory bridges this gap.
      With deep engineering expertise and hands‑on founder experience, we help teams evaluate the true potential
      of early‑stage technologies, reduce uncertainty, and establish a structured path from lab insight to
      market‑ready innovation.
    </p>

    <h4>What we do</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Assess the technical maturity of discoveries and prototypes</li>
      <li>Evaluate internal capabilities, resources, and constraints</li>
      <li>Apply TRL/MRL frameworks to structure development</li>
      <li>Guide early prototyping and supplier selection</li>
      <li>Support outsourcing decisions and integration of external expertise</li>
      <li>Provide embedded coaching to internal teams</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Outcomes</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear roadmap from discovery to commercial prototype</li>
      <li>Reduced complexity and faster decision‑making</li>
      <li>First‑time‑right development cycles</li>
      <li>Lower engineering costs compared to traditional providers</li>
      <li>Stronger internal capability building</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Case Example</h4>
    <p>
      A university‑affiliated team developed a novel materials‑based technology and filed initial patents.
      Tasked with building a commercial prototype, they lacked experience in scaling from lab setups to
      industrial systems. VAIRA evaluated the technical maturity, defined a TRL‑based development plan,
      identified suitable suppliers, oversaw BOM decisions, and supported early market analysis—accelerating
      their path toward commercialization.
