        <article class="card">
          <h3>Founder‑Operator Experience</h3>
          <p>
            VAIRA was founded by Raphael Heeb, co‑founder and former CEO of NEMATX AG, a deep‑tech company 
            developing high‑performance additive manufacturing systems. We bring the perspective of having 
            built and industrialized complex technology ourselves.

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Hands‑On, Not Slideware</h3>
          <p>
            We work embedded with your teams — in engineering, operations and with suppliers — to diagnose 
            real constraints, design robust solutions, and ensure they work on the line.

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Deep‑Tech & Advanced Manufacturing Focus</h3>
          <p>
            Our work sits where materials, hardware, processes and production meet. We are comfortable in 
            complex, regulated and high‑performance environments.

          <h3>Senior‑Only Delivery</h3>
          <p>
            No leverage model, no junior teams. You work directly with senior expertise throughout — from 
            first conversation to implementation.

      <h2>How We Work</h2>
      <p>
        We combine engineering depth with operational pragmatism. Our work is hands‑on, collaborative and 
        grounded in real‑world constraints — from materials and processes to equipment, suppliers and 
        production lines.
      </p>
      <p>
        We focus on solving the right problems, reducing complexity, and building scalable solutions that 
        work reliably in industrial environments.
