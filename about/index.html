    <h2 class="section-title">Our Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      VAIRA Advisory was founded on a simple belief: deep‑tech innovation succeeds when 
      engineering excellence meets strategic focus. We help organizations navigate complexity 
      in advanced manufacturing, materials, and industrial technologies—translating ideas into 
      robust, scalable, and commercially relevant solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our approach combines analytical rigor with a pragmatic, hands‑on mindset shaped by 
      real industrial experience. We work with clients who value precision, clarity, and 
      intentional design in both technology and strategy.

    <div class="three-columns">
      <div class="column">
        <h3>Engineering Rigor</h3>
        <p>
          We bring a systems‑level understanding of materials, processes, and industrialization. 
          This mindset is grounded in more than 15 years of experience driving innovation at the 
          intersection of advanced manufacturing and materials science.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="column">
        <h3>Strategic Clarity</h3>
        <p>
          We help teams identify what truly matters—technically and commercially. From technology 
          scouting to R&D‑to‑market integration, we focus on decisions that accelerate progress 
          and reduce uncertainty.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="column">
        <h3>Collaborative Execution</h3>
        <p>
          We work side‑by‑side with engineering, R&D, and business teams across Europe, Asia, 
          and the US. Our role is to enable momentum, align stakeholders, and ensure that 
          innovation translates into measurable outcomes.
