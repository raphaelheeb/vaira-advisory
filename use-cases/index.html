    <!-- USE CASE 1 -->
    <div class="case-block">
      <h3>Digital Manufacturing Architecture for a High‑Precision Components Producer</h3>
      <p class="case-theme">Industry 4.0 · MES Integration · Data Architecture</p>

      <p>
        A precision components manufacturer needed a unified digital manufacturing architecture to replace fragmented shop‑floor data flows and inconsistent reporting. Their goal was to establish a scalable foundation for predictive insights and automated traceability.
      </p>

      <ul class="case-list">
        <li>Designed a modular data architecture for shop‑floor systems</li>
        <li>Defined MES–ERP integration patterns and event‑driven data flows</li>
        <li>Introduced a unified telemetry model for CNC, CMM, and inspection systems</li>
        <li>Established data governance for quality, lineage, and traceability</li>
        <li>Delivered a phased Industry 4.0 implementation roadmap</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="case-impact">
        <strong>Impact:</strong> Improved data availability and traceability across production lines, enabling faster root‑cause analysis and reducing manual reporting effort.
      </p>

    </div>

    <!-- USE CASE 2 -->
    <div class="case-block">
      <h3>Predictive Maintenance Framework for Industrial Equipment Fleet</h3>
      <p class="case-theme">AI/ML · Sensor Fusion · Reliability Engineering</p>

      <p>
        An equipment manufacturer aimed to transition from reactive service operations to predictive maintenance. Their challenge was heterogeneous PLC interfaces, inconsistent sensor data, and no unified analytics pipeline.
      </p>

      <ul class="case-list">
        <li>Defined a sensor fusion strategy across vibration, thermal, and operational data</li>
        <li>Architected a scalable analytics pipeline for anomaly detection</li>
        <li>Developed feature engineering templates for mechanical degradation patterns</li>
        <li>Introduced a reliability‑centered maintenance decision model</li>
        <li>Supported pilot deployment and KPI definition</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="case-impact">
        <strong>Impact:</strong> Enabled early detection of failure signatures and reduced unplanned downtime through a repeatable predictive maintenance methodology.
      </p>

    </div>

    <!-- USE CASE 3 -->
    <div class="case-block">
      <h3>End‑to‑End Process Optimization for a High‑Mix, Low‑Volume Factory</h3>
      <p class="case-theme">Operations Engineering · Digital Twins · Flow Optimization</p>

      <p>
        A high‑mix electronics manufacturer struggled with long changeovers, variable takt, and limited visibility into bottlenecks. They needed a structured, engineering‑driven approach to optimize flow without compromising quality.
      </p>

      <ul class="case-list">
        <li>Built a digital twin of the production flow to simulate routing and capacity scenarios</li>
        <li>Identified systemic bottlenecks using queueing and throughput analysis</li>
        <li>Designed a new scheduling logic for high‑mix production</li>
        <li>Defined a data‑driven changeover strategy and operator workflow improvements</li>
        <li>Created a KPI framework for continuous optimization</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="case-impact">
        <strong>Impact:</strong> Achieved measurable throughput gains and reduced changeover variability, enabling more predictable delivery performance.
